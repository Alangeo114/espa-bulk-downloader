ESPA Bulk Download Client Version 1.0.0. [Tested with Python 2.7]

Retrieves all completed scenes for the user/order
and places them into the target directory.
Scenes are organized by order.

It is safe to cancel and restart the client, as it will
only download scenes one time (per directory)
 
If you intend to automate execution of this script,
please take care to ensure only 1 instance runs at a time.
Also please do not schedule execution more frequently than
once per hour.
